# TowerDefensePrototype
Welcome to this prototype of a tower defense game. It has two branches, a desktop and an android version. Main differences are desktop is using mouse controls, while the mobile version is based on touch input. There is no other difference between them.

## Desktop Version
### For Testing
Just run the included .exe file

### For Building
Make sure your open scenes have been added to the project build settings ( Main Menu and Game Scene). Do not change platforms and build.

## Mobile Version
### For Testing
Install the included .apk file in your Android device, it should be running Android version over 4.4.2 for it to run properly, but the latest version is highly recommended.

### For Building
Make sure the target platform is Android and your scenes have been loaded. On Adroid settings check that minimum SDK is set to KitKat(4.4) and target is set to Highest Installed
